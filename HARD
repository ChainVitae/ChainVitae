1	gas cost
    must maintain good complexity & in practice
    every "bit" is money
    cannot even deploy the contract if too complex
    String can be arbitrary long
    encode into bytesxx to contraint the length
    then decode
2.	institution name ~= domain name registration problem

3.	must be bug-free
4.	cannot alter/update afterwards
5.  privacy (potentially Hyperledger would be more suitable?)
6.  very different from normal coding:
    no pointers/reference deep copy only
    strings can be arbitrarily long encode into hex decode at 

why choose ethereum
bitcoin vs ethereum
smart contract turing complete
code snippet
simple interaction with blockchain
solidity
why not searching?
    - open research
